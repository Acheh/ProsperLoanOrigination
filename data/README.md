Data Description

Prosper loan data set used in this project was taken from:
https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1524680435404000.

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Data cleaning was performed to the data set to extract only the 36-month loans (excluding canceled loans) from period 2006 to 2013. Then, CreditGrade and ProsperScore were combined together to measure Loan Grade. Finally, quarterly loan origination amount and quarterly loan origination count were calculated based on Loan Grade.
