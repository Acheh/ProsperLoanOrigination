Summary

Prosper, founded in California in 2005 and opened to the public on February 2, 2006, is a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows people to invest in each other by connecting investors and borrowers through its service. The company faced a rocky start in their early years as the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 hit market and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a cease and desist order on November 24, 2008, requiring them to register their business under the Security Act. In July 2009, Prosper relaunch their business after having obtained SEC registration for its loans. In this visualization project, I want to show the company's history through its quarterly loan origination performance from it first opened to public to the last quarter of 2013. Hopefully, viewers can see how the SEC cease and desist order impacted Prosper and how the company moved forward from it.

The comparative data of quarterly loan origination amount is displayed in a stacked bar chart based on loan grade (measured from HR - AA from the lowest to the highest based on the risk of borrower to go default on the loan).  Loan origination can be displayed in dollar amount or in percentage to help with grade composition comparison. Data can be filtered to display only a certain loan grade to see trend within the selected loan grade over the time. Finally, A horizontal guide line is provided as a mouse event to the graph to easily display the y-axis value (loan amount/percentage) at cursor position.
